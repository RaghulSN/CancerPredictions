# ðŸ©º Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

Predicting cancer early can significantly improve treatment outcomes.  
This project uses **machine learning models** to estimate the likelihood of cancer diagnosis from patient health data, exploring advanced preprocessing, handling of imbalanced datasets, and rigorous model evaluation.
